# Project 1
All the instructions are given in the Jupyter Notebook project1.ipynb

# Installation instructions

You can run the Jupyter notebook for the project either using a local installation of Python on your computer or directly on Google Colab without the need to install any additional software.

## With a local Python installation:

You will need to have a local installation of Python (3.7 to 3.9 recommended). We recommend that you install Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

You then will need to install 
1. [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), which is a rigid body dynamics library
2. [Meshcat](https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat-python), which is a convenient visualizer

With an Anaconda installation, you can run the following:
``conda install pinocchio meshcat-python``

Your environment should then be all set to run the Notebook.


## On Google Colab:

You will need to run Google Colab on Chrome (the robot display does not appear to work on Firefox nor Safari). The notebook should work out of the box (although running the first cell will take some time as it needs to install a few packages in the Colab environment).
